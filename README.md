# Notes for the Practical Deep Learning Series
This repo contains workshop notes and code from the Practical Deep Learning Series with the Toronto Data Literacy Group.

Session 1 discuses background theory for artificial neural networks (ANNs), deep learning, and computation graph based libraries, particularly Google's TensorFlow.  

Session 2 introduces the ANNs covered in session 1 in the form of TensorFlow code.
